## About Our App

Our app is a simple-to-use playlist generator app

___

### Here is how it works:

* 💻 A user registers or logs in
* 📝 The user inputs an entry
* 🎭 Through a sentiment analysis API, a mood score is generated
* 🎵 Through a Spotify API a playlist is generated based on the mood score
* 🔗 The user is given a link to their new spotify playlist
* 🎧 The user can listen to their playlist!

### Extras:
* A user can see their historical data such as:
  * all playlist data 
  * all moods
  * if users consistently get low mood scores this is flagged, 
  and they are given links to mental health helplines or charities
